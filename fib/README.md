# Milestone 1 - Fibonaci

### You are generating code only for the .expand files, and integrating them
with a larger program

To compile the source, do:

```shell
make 
```

This function does not print anything, but the correct output from the
command

```shell
make; make run
```

is 89.

You'll want to change the SRCS variable in the Makefile to your assembly (.s)
file.
